1. Create a delete button
  Notes: I think a for loop could be used here to assign
  a unique id to each note. Then a button could delete 
  the individual note based on what the id === 
  
2. Make it so that each sticky notes' text can be edited
  Notes: The for loop from item [1] could be used here to
  count each note. Then, we have to look at storing the 
  text that is currently in the note, and then editing it
  with a prompt or something.
  
3. Possible ---- Create a custom prompt box or text area
  Notes: I would like to create a custom prompt box or te-
  xt area that looked very clean and fluid in this app. 
  It would be more intuitive than having a popup prompt.
